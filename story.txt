a didactic octopus with eight umbrellas sat at her table doing homeowork. She knows, though,
that more needs to be done for people. And that means standing up and trying to take action,
even when they are afraid to speak up. "I do feel really proud that I have a daughter. But I
cannot talk about what happened because she is only three."
Before she had her daughter she used to use her eight arms to stand up against injustice
against the people. When her rebellous group took action she was the most efficient being
able to hold 8 signs at once. However this past remains a myserty to our didaditc friend's
daughter as she was once arrested by the evil company making everyone sick.

Little did she know the CEO of that evil company was her little three year old.  Cunningly, 
the CEO transfered his body into that baby's body.  This octopus took note of every move the
didactic octopus took.  He waited to strike and inflict ilness upon our hero, for his mother
threw-up when everyone got sick.
